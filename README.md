# Project Description: User Authentication System with Gmail Integration

I would like to introduce my project, a User Authentication System with Gmail Integration. This project encompasses essential user account management functionalities such as registration, login, and password recovery. Additionally, the registration and password recovery processes are seamlessly integrated with Gmail for account verification.

## Key Features

- **User Registration**: Allows users to create new accounts by providing their email addresses, usernames, and passwords.

- **User Login**: Enables registered users to securely log in to their accounts using their email and password.

- **Password Recovery**: Offers a password recovery mechanism for users who have forgotten their passwords. This feature sends a password reset link to their registered Gmail addresses.

- **Gmail Integration**: Utilizes Gmail for email verification during the registration process and for sending password reset links. This ensures the security and authenticity of user accounts.

- **Landing Page**: Includes visually appealing and user-friendly landing pages for both registration and password recovery processes.

## Technology Stack

- **Programming Language**: PHP
- **Framework**: CodeIgniter 3
- **Front-End**: Bootstrap CSS
- **Email Handling**: SMTP email for sending account verification and password reset emails.

## Motivation

This project was developed to enhance user experience and security when interacting with web applications. The integration with Gmail not only simplifies the registration and password recovery processes but also adds an extra layer of account verification.

## Future Enhancements

I plan to further improve this project by adding additional security measures, optimizing user interfaces, and expanding the integration with other email services. I also welcome feedback and contributions from the development community to make this system even more robust.
